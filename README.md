Web-based vanilla Hearthstone currently in development. 


run npm install


To-do List:

- Get card images and sound effects.

- Use jquery for draggable/droppable and many operations on single elements or sets of elements.

- Start using something like storybook for the html/css elements, so they can be developed without having to play the entire game.

- Create a functioning server. Current server.js is from a scrabble game I made-- will need major rewriting but there's a lot there that might be useful to start with.
